// Task: "To-Do List with Priority System"

// Objective: Build a simple to-do list application with the ability to mark tasks as "high priority" or "low priority" and sort the tasks based on priority.
// Steps:

//     Create a state variable for the list of to-dos. Each to-do should have:
//         A task (string) that describes the to-do.
//         A priority (string), which can be either "High" or "Low".

//     Create two input fields:
//         One for entering the to-do task.
//         One for selecting the priority (using a dropdown menu with options "High" and "Low").

//     Create a button to add the to-do item to the list.

//     When a to-do item is added, the task should be appended to the list with its corresponding priority.

//     Create a button that will allow you to sort the list by priority:
//         The high-priority tasks should appear at the top of the list.
//         The low-priority tasks should appear at the bottom.

//     Display the to-dos in a list, showing the task and its priority.

//     Bonus:
//         Add a feature to delete a task from the list.
//         Add a check mark or other visual indicator to mark tasks as "completed."

// Expected Outcome:

//     The app should allow adding tasks with their respective priorities.
//     You should be able to sort the tasks by priority with a button click.
//     The task list should update dynamically as new tasks are added or deleted.
